# Intro to Functions

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## Defining functions
Function declarations
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:

```javascript
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}
```

The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The statement return specifies the value returned by the function:

```javascript
return number * number;
```

write once, use many times
```javascript

// Declare the function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Call the function
add(1, 3);
// 4
```

```javascript
